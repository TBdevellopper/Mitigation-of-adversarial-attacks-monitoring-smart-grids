# Mitigation-of-adversarial-attacks-monitoring-smart-grids
These files describe an experiment performed on phasor measurement unites dataset that is made publicly available . The goal of the experiment is to train a deep network to be resilient against any adversarial attacks. A specific Robust feature engineering and a deep learning are involved in model reconstructions. fast gradient sign method and basic iterative method are involved in this case.

Notes: (i) To be able to produce experiments provided in of these codes, you have to run the "*.m" files in the directory in alphabetical order. (ii) Then you can plot results starting by any "plot...*.m" files.
